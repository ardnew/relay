# Relay

An extremely dangerous tool for executing arbitrary shell commands in the GUI login context on macOS.

> [!WARNING]
> The risk associated with such a service should be obvious. DO NOT USE THIS TOOL.

## Overview

Relay opens a TCP listener for each specified interactive shell on localhost at incremental ports.
When a client connects to one of these ports, it must first send an "end-of-file" (EOF) marker followed by a single newline. It then sends the contents of a shell script to execute, followed by the EOF marker on its own line, again followed by a newline.

Relay copies the script content received to disk until it reaches the EOF marker, executes the script in a new shell (corresponding to the port on which the client connected), and copies all output (stdout and stderr) back to the client and then closes the connection.

### Purpose

On macOS, not all shells have equivalent privileges. In particular, when a user logs in via SSH, the user does not have the same privileges as those given to the same user physically logged into the macOS desktop. When [relay is configured as a LaunchAgent](#configuration) in the GUI domain, a user connecting via SSH can "relay" commands through the LaunchAgent to effectively execute commands with GUI privileges.

## Usage

```
Usage: relay [options] [shells...]
Options:
  -j    use JSON structured logging
  -p int
        base port to listen on (default 50135)
```

### Example

Either prepare the service as a LaunchAgent [as described in Configuration](#configuration), or run the server temporarily (from a GUI terminal logged in to the macOS desktop):

```sh
# Start a zsh service listening on 50135 and a bash service listening on 50136.
relay -p 50135 zsh bash
```

To send commands to execute, you can use a tool such as netcat (`nc`) or `telnet`, for example:

```sh
# Send a command to the zsh service
echo -e "EOF\nls -la\nEOF\n" | nc localhost 50135

# Send a shell script to the bash service
nc localhost 50136 < <( echo _EOF_; cat script.sh; echo _EOF_; )
```

A [relay-command.sh](docs/relay-command.sh) shell script is also provided that allows you to simply provide the commands to execute as command-line arguments, which is convenient for single commands:

```sh
relay-command.sh ls -la
```

## Installation

There are two options to install the `relay` executable without manually retrieving and compiling from source:

### Build with standard toolchain (_recommended_):

```sh
go install -v github.com/ardnew/relay@latest
```

### Download binary release package:

Visit the [releases page](https://github.com/ardnew/relay/releases) to download the latest binary release for your platform.

## Configuration

To install the `relay` service as a LaunchAgent, copy the provided [LaunchAgent plist file](docs/com.github.ardnew.relay.plist) to your service directory, update any paths defined in it, and load it with:

```sh
# Note you _must_ use the full absolute file path with launchctl.
# Using "~" or relative paths will result in an error.
launchctl load -w /Users/you/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.ardnew.relay.plist
launchctl enable gui/$( id -u )/com.github.ardnew.relay
launchctl start gui/$( id -u )/com.github.ardnew.relay
```

## Development

This project was developed using:

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (settings provided in [`.vscode/settings.json`](.vscode/settings.json))
- [Go standard toolchain](https://golang.org/doc/) (version specified in [`go.mod`](go.mod)),
- [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) (configuration in [`.golangci.yml`](.golangci.yml)),


### Build

To build the project with unstripped symbols for use with a debugger:

```sh
go build -v -gcflags='-N -l'
```
